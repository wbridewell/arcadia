Recording Movies
===

ARCADIA can record a model run as a movie and/or a sequence of images, so that a viewer can see what the model's display components were showing on each cycle of the run. To record a movie, simply include the keyword argument `:record? true` in the call to `arcadia.core/startup`. The movie file will be given a name describing when it was created; for example, `2019-04-16_10-00-10.mp4` indicates that the movie was created on April 16, 2019, at 10 am and 10 seconds. The file will be saved to the `movies` directory in the top-level ARCADIA directory (a directory will be created if necessary).

Movie files are created using the [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) command line tool. Thus, the user must have this tool installed before movies can be built. However, it is possible to save a sequence of images (one per cycle of processing) even without ffmpeg. To specify that images should be saved instead of a movie, use the keyword argument `:recording-parameters {:make-movie? false :make-images? true}` in the call to `arcadia.core/startup` -- note that images will be saved to the images directory to the top-level ARCADIA directory. There are several other recording parameters that can be used to further customize the recording process (for example, `:frame-rate` can be used to set the movie frame rate). See `arcadia.utility.recording` for the full list of recording parameters and their default values.
