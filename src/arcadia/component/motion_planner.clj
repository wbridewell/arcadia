;; Actions, or more accurately, requests to initiate an action, do not operate
;; directly on the environment. Instead, once they are focused on, they must be
;; translated into a format that can be processed by the environment. Here, for
;; instance, the request to push a button is turned into an element that has
;; an action-command (a button name) that ARCADIA then passes to the environment
;; to initiate the effects.

;; NOTE:
;; It takes roughly 150 ms to plan a motor response, and under time pressure,
;; people can react that quickly, but often there is an extra 80 ms delay that
;; may make room for alternative responses to compete.

;; Movement Preparation and Movement Initiation. Journal of Neuroscience,
;; 36(10), 3007â€“3015.

;; NOTE:
;; Only actions that have a corresponding environment action will be delayed.
;; For instance, another component could engage in processing just based on
;; the action request. That happens with "memorize," which is used as a quick
;; and dirty approach to getting elements into some nebulous notion of
;; working memory. So memorization may not be delayed, but multiple button
;; presses will be subject to delay because the environmental action will be
;; withheld for a specific period of time.
