The current version of libpython-clj requires JDK 17 or under to work properly due to API changes in Java's foreign function interface. Consequently, ARCADIA must be run in JDK 17 to use Gym-Minigrid. 

Homebrew builds OpenCV against OpenJDK 18, which means that the opencv-455.jar file that it produces cannot be used with JDK 17. However, we can still use the Homebrew opencv installation. 

The current workaround is to manually build opencv to get a java library and jar file that works with JDK 17. Instructions for this are available.

There are some minor changes you should make to get opencv to build.

First, opencv 4.5.5 requires a 4.x release of ffmpeg. OpenCV 4.6.0 builds with 5.x, but is not in Homebrew, yet.

Before building OpenCV, execute this command.
brew link ffmpeg@4

Ensure that you are using version 4.5.5 of OpenCV
git checkout 4.5.5

Building OpenCV successfully requires WITH_OPENEXR=OFF as in the following command, which I have executed from a separate cmake_opencv directory. 

cmake -DOPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON -DWITH_OPENEXR=OFF -S ../opencv -B ../build_opencv

When the build finishes, the jar file will be at 
    build_opencv/bin/opencv-455.jar 
and the dynamic library will be at 
    build_opencv/lib/libopencv_java455.dylib
